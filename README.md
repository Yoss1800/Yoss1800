### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A full stack web developer. I strive every day to be the best possible version of myself, for this I have developed the capacity for resilience and autonomy that are so necessary in technology and in life in general.

<hr/>

Goal oriented and team work believer. Currently based in Argentina, but have lived also in the USA and Israel. Have working experience with multi-cultural teams (Anglo-Saxon, Latin-American & Asian).

After 20+ years fulfilling leading roles in the TV industry, jumped into a new adventure chasing left aside dreams and aspirations: software development.

My strong visual orientation and storytelling skills lead me to web development.Teamwork have always been the core on every project IÂ´m glad to join.

I started a bootcamp of Full Stack Developer, which I completed with 100% approval of all checkpoints, individual project and final project. It adds more than 700 hours of code ending with two published applications, including a fully functional marketplace. The final project was carried out by a team of 6 programmers, sharing repositories on GitHub. Working under a SCRUM methodology in one-week sprints, presenting to a Product Owner the progress on the development of a rental on demand marketplace app. My problem-solving skills along with my experience leading and motivating big teams made me team leader, a key to the project success.

I have just finished the bootcamp as a Full-Stack Developer, but itÂ´s clear that software development is a lifelong self-learning journey, and I am willing to learn new technologies as required in work environments.
I have C2 level of English as a second language.

BTW, IÂ´m a cyclist and triathlete too. Taking the hardness and commitment of endurance sports to every step in my life.
